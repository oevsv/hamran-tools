# hamran-tools

The HAMRAN[^1] (Highspeed Amateur Multimedia Radio Access Network) project is
an attempt to create a "broadband" modem for amateur radio. The project is
loosely inspired by the standard IEEE 802.22 which is targeted at the so called
*white spaces* in the television frequency spectrum.

The particular challenges of this project are the frequency range of 50 MHz,
which is low by today's standards, and the relatively large bandwidth.

The project has several predecessors, the latest of which can be found on
[GitHub][1].

The hamran-tools are intended to support hardware development and trouble
shooting of the HAMRAN modem. The modem by itself will eventually get its own
project repository.

Some information also might be found on this [blog][3].

## The Project now is Hosted on Radicle

Depending on how you obtained this copy of the tools you possibly already know
what Radicle is. If not: It is a peer to peer (P2P) forge for github projects.
While full colaboration with the project is easiest by installing a copy of
[Radicle][2] on your machine, this is not required if you just want to get hold of
a copy of the git repository, in which case you simply may

    git clone https://seed.radicle.garden/z4CzhULrd3JUfUoGcBk8u8sXqJGnt.git hamran-tools

to get a downstream clone.
